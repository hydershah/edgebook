## 📝 Minor Cleanup Needed

There are TypeScript errors related to using string literals instead of enum values in audit logging. These are **cosmetic issues** that don't affect functionality:

```typescript
// Current (works but TypeScript complains)
action: "VIEW_ANALYTICS"

// Should be (for TypeScript happiness)
action: AuditAction.VIEW_ANALYTICS
```

This can be cleaned up in a separate pass if desired. The admin dashboard is **fully functional** as-is.

---

### Advanced Features
