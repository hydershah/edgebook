# Sportradar Integration Complete

## Integration Summary

The GameSelector and PredictionSelector components have been successfully integrated into the create pick page.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Component Imports
Added imports for the two new components at the top of [app/createpick/page.tsx](app/createpick/page.tsx):
```typescript
import GameSelector from '@/components/GameSelector'
import PredictionSelector from '@/components/PredictionSelector'
```

### 2. State Management
Added state variables to track selected game and prediction data (lines 152-170):
```typescript
// Game selection state
const [selectedGame, setSelectedGame] = useState<{
  id: string;
  league: string;
  homeTeam: string;
  awayTeam: string;
  scheduled: string;
  status: string;
  venue?: string;
} | null>(null)

// Prediction data state
const [predictionData, setPredictionData] = useState<{
  predictionType: 'WINNER' | 'SPREAD' | 'TOTAL';
  predictedWinner?: string;
  spreadValue?: number;
  spreadTeam?: string;
  totalValue?: number;
  totalPrediction?: 'OVER' | 'UNDER';
} | null>(null)
```

### 3. Game Selection Handler
Added `handleGameSelect` function (lines 278-288) that:
- Stores the selected game
- Auto-populates the matchup field
- Auto-populates the game date

### 4. Enhanced Form Submission
Updated the `onSubmit` function (lines 307-320) to include:
- Sportradar game data (game ID, teams, status, venue)
- Prediction data (type, winner, spread, total)

### 5. UI Components Added
Added two new sections to the form (lines 480-506):

**Game Selector** (shows when sport is selected):
- Fetches games from Sportradar API
- Displays games with search functionality
- Shows game details (teams, date, venue, status)

**Prediction Selector** (shows when game is selected):
- Sport-specific prediction types
- Three modes: WINNER, SPREAD, TOTAL
- Validation based on sport betting rules

### 6. Updated Matchup Field
Made the matchup input read-only (lines 508-522):
- Now auto-populated from selected game
- Gray background to indicate read-only state
- Disabled until game is selected

### 7. Form Validation Update
Removed future date validation from `gameDate` field (lines 61-66) since the Sportradar API only returns upcoming games.

## User Flow

```
1. User selects sport (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, Soccer, CFB, CBB)
   ↓
2. GameSelector appears, fetches games from Sportradar
   ↓
3. User searches/browses and selects a game
   ↓
4. Matchup and game date auto-fill
   ↓
5. PredictionSelector appears with sport-specific options
   ↓
6. User selects prediction type (Winner/Spread/Total)
   ↓
7. User enters prediction details
   ↓
8. User adds analysis and submits pick
   ↓
9. Pick created with full Sportradar game data
   ↓
10. Cron job automatically updates results when game completes
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_prediction_and_result_fields
```

This will add all the new Sportradar and prediction fields to the Pick model.

### 2. Test the Flow
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/createpick
2. Select a sport (NBA recommended - works with trial API)
3. Wait for games to load
4. Search for a team or browse games
5. Click on a game to select it
6. See matchup and date auto-fill
7. Select prediction type
8. Enter prediction details
9. Fill in analysis and submit

### 3. Set Up Cron Job
Configure a cron job to run every 5 minutes:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/sportradar/sync-results
```
