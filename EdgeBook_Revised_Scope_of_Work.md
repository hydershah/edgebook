## Critical Path Items (Launch Blockers)

The following features **MUST** be completed before public launch:

1. ‚úÖ **Database & Authentication** (Completed)
2. ‚úÖ **Legal Compliance Pages** (Completed)
3. ‚è≥ **Age Verification** (In Progress) - Legal requirement
4. ‚è≥ **Stripe Connect** (Not Started) - Cannot pay creators without this
5. ‚è≥ **Admin Dashboard** (Not Started) - Cannot moderate platform
6. ‚è≥ **Timestamp Locking** (Not Started) - Prevents fraud
7. ‚è≥ **Sports Data API** (Not Started) - Enables automation
8. ‚è≥ **Fraud Prevention** (Not Started) - Anti-self-purchase, flagging
9. ‚è≥ **Reporting System** (Not Started) - User safety

**Estimated Time to Launch-Ready MVP:** 10-12 weeks from current date (mid-January 2026)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Stripe Connect Integration Delays** | Cannot launch; creators can't get paid | Start immediately; allocate 2 full weeks; test extensively in Stripe test mode |
| **Sports API Costs** | Monthly costs $500-$5000+ depending on provider | Budget accordingly; start with The Odds API (lower cost); implement caching |
| **Legal/Regulatory Issues** | Platform shutdown, lawsuits | Consult attorney before launch; implement robust age verification; clear ToS |
| **Fraud at Scale** | Platform reputation damage | Implement all fraud prevention measures before launch; monitor closely post-launch |
| **Payment Processing Issues** | Lost revenue, user trust | Extensive testing; Stripe test mode; small real transactions before full launch |

### Medium-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Content Piracy** | Premium content shared freely | Watermarking, monitoring, ToS enforcement |
| **User Acquisition** | Low user base, poor network effects | Marketing budget; creator incentives; referral program |
| **Performance at Scale** | Slow load times, poor UX | Load testing; database optimization; CDN for assets |

### Low-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Third-Party Service Downtime** | Temporary feature unavailability | Graceful degradation; status page; error handling |
| **Browser Compatibility** | Some users can't access | Cross-browser testing; progressive enhancement |

## Post-Launch Roadmap (Phase 5+)

### 30-Day Post-Launch Priorities
1. Monitor analytics and user feedback
2. Fix critical bugs and performance issues
3. Optimize conversion funnels based on data
4. Scale infrastructure if needed
5. Enhance fraud detection based on observed patterns

### Future Enhancements (3-6 Months)

2. **Advanced Analytics** for creators (deeper insights dashboard)
3. **Subscription Model** (monthly subscriptions to creators)
4. **Group/Community Features** (private prediction groups)
5. **Affiliate/Referral Program** (user acquisition incentives)
6. **Live Predictions** (in-game predictions)
7. **Parlay Builder** (multi-leg prediction tool)
8. **Social Sharing** (share picks to Twitter/Instagram)
9. **Push Notifications** (mobile app engagement)
10. **API for Third Parties** (sports app integrations)
