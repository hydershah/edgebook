## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Why Whop over Stripe**:
   - Built-in support for crypto payments
   - Simpler subscription management
   - Better international payout support
   - Lower integration complexity

2. **Database Design**:
   - Audit trail for all transactions
   - Separate Purchase and Transaction models
   - Configuration versioning for history

3. **Security**:
   - Webhook signature validation
   - Role-based access control
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - No storage of sensitive payment data

4. **Performance**:
   - Indexed database queries
   - Background job processing
   - Caching for configuration
   - Batch operations for webhooks

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review and approve the payment system design
2. Set up Whop account and obtain API keys
3. Create development/test environment
4. Begin database migration

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for fee calculations
- Integration tests for payment flows
- Load testing for concurrent purchases
- End-to-end subscription lifecycle tests

### Deployment Considerations
- Feature flag for gradual rollout
- Parallel running with Stripe initially
- Data migration from existing purchases
- Rollback plan if issues arise

## Configuration Defaults

```typescript
const defaultConfig = {
  platformFee: 15,              // 15% platform fee
  minPickPrice: 0.50,           // $0.50 minimum
  maxPickPrice: 10000,          // $10,000 maximum
  minSubscription: 4.99,        // $4.99 minimum
  maxSubscription: 999.99,      // $999.99 maximum
  withdrawalMinimum: 10,        // $10 minimum
  autoWithdrawThreshold: 100,  // $100 auto-withdraw
  supportedMethods: ['card', 'ach', 'crypto', 'bnpl'],
  payoutMethods: ['bank', 'crypto', 'paypal']
};
```
