## Environment Setup Required

Before testing, ensure these environment variables are set:

# Whop Configuration
WHOP_API_KEY="your_whop_api_key"
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_webhook_secret"
WHOP_APP_ID="your_app_id"
WHOP_ENVIRONMENT="test"
WHOP_API_URL="https://api.whop.com/v5"

# Payment Configuration
PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE="15"
DEFAULT_MIN_PAYOUT="1000"
AUTO_WITHDRAWAL_THRESHOLD="10000"
```

## Migration Notes

### From Stripe to Whop
- Old Stripe fields retained as optional
- New Whop fields added alongside
- Both systems can run in parallel
- Gradual migration recommended
- No data loss during transition

### Database Compatibility
- Schema backward compatible
- Existing purchases preserved
- Transaction history maintained
- Users not affected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Webhook signature validation failed"**
- Check WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET is correct
- Verify signature header is present
- Ensure raw body is used for validation

**"Purchase not completing"**
- Check webhook endpoint is accessible
- Verify webhook is configured in Whop dashboard
- Check webhook event logs in database
- Review application logs for errors

**"Payment not redirecting"**
- Ensure checkout URL is returned from API
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Whop payment was created successfully

**"Balance not updating"**
- Check webhook was processed
- Verify transactions were created
- Review transaction records in database
- Check for webhook processing errors

## Performance Considerations

- Webhook processing is asynchronous
- Database indexes added for queries
- Pagination recommended for large lists
- Caching can be added for configuration

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics post-launch:
- Payment success rate
- Webhook processing time
- Purchase conversion rate
- Subscription retention rate
- Average transaction value
- Platform fee revenue
- Creator earnings growth
