3. **What's the commission structure?** (Platform cut?)
4. **Minimum viable feature set?** (Can we launch without some features?)
5. **Budget for legal compliance?** (This could be expensive)
6. **Do you have a sports data API budget?** (These can cost $500-$5000/month)
7. **What payment processors are you comfortable with?** (Stripe, PayPal, crypto?)
8. **Moderation approach?** (Automated, human moderators, hybrid?)
9. **Mobile-first or web-first?**
10. **How to bootstrap the network?** (Chicken-and-egg: need creators to attract viewers, need viewers to attract creators)

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Legal Consultation**: Speak with a lawyer ASAP
2. **Market Research**: Validate demand (survey potential users)
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Study Discord betting groups, Telegram channels, paid picks services
4. **Technical Validation**: Test sports data APIs, payment processors
5. **Financial Modeling**: Calculate unit economics (revenue per user, costs, break-even)
6. **Wireframes/Mockups**: Design key user flows
7. **Database Schema**: Design data models for users, predictions, transactions, etc.

## Conclusion

Edge Book has strong potential but requires careful execution, especially around:
- **Legal compliance** (gambling regulations)
- **Fraud prevention** (manipulated accuracy stats)
- **Payment security** (handling real money)
- **User trust** (verification, moderation)

The pay-per-view model is innovative, but you may want to also offer:
- Subscriptions (more predictable revenue)
- Free tier with ads (lower barrier to entry)
- Freemium model (some free predictions to build trust)

**Biggest concern**: Legal/regulatory risk. Consult with an attorney before writing any code.

**Biggest opportunity**: If executed well, this could disrupt the fragmented "paid picks" market currently happening in Discord/Telegram.
