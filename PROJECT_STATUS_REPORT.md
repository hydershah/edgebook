# EdgeBook.ai - Project Status Report
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Client:** Travis Shipley
**Platform:** EdgeBook.ai (Railway Deployment)
**Assessed Against:** 4-Phase Development Scope of Work

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Completion: ~60%**

The EdgeBook.ai platform has solid foundational architecture with authentication, database schema, and basic marketplace features implemented. However, **critical business-blocking features are missing**, particularly:

- **Stripe Connect** (creator payout system) - Platform cannot pay creators
- **Age Verification** (Stripe Identity) - Compliance risk
- **Admin Dashboard** - No moderation capabilities
- **Sports Data API** - No automated result verification
- **Fraud Prevention** - Timestamp locking and anti-gaming measures

**Estimated Time to Launch-Ready MVP:** 8-10 additional weeks

## Critical Gaps Summary

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking Launch)

| Issue | Impact | Location | Estimated Fix Time |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **No Stripe Connect** | Platform cannot pay creators | [CreatorSettings.tsx:117](app/profile/settings/tabs/CreatorSettings.tsx#L117) | 2-3 weeks |
| **No Age Verification** | Legal/compliance risk | [ComplianceConsent.tsx](components/ComplianceConsent.tsx) | 1 week |
| **No Admin Dashboard** | Cannot moderate platform | Missing `/app/admin` | 2-3 weeks |
| **No Timestamp Locking** | Fraud: post after events | [api/picks/route.ts](app/api/picks/route.ts) | 3-5 days |
| **No Sports Data API** | No automated verification | N/A | 2 weeks |
| **Anti-Self-Purchase** | Fraud: game rankings | [api/picks/[pickId]/unlock](app/api/picks/[pickId]/unlock/route.ts) | 1 week |

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Can Launch with Workarounds)

| Issue | Impact | Workaround |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **No Reporting System** | Manual moderation harder | Use email initially |
| **No Analytics** | No user insights | Add post-launch |
| **Weak Content Protection** | Premium content exposed | Manual enforcement |
| **No In-App Notifications** | Reduced engagement | Email only initially |

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

- Advanced fraud detection algorithms
- Screenshot prevention
- Watermarking
- Push notifications
- Real-time updates

## Payment Milestone Assessment

Based on the Scope of Work payment structure:

| Phase | Payment % | Status | Completion | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Phase 1** | 20% | Partial | 75% | **Pay 15%** - Missing age verification & admin |
| **Phase 2** | 30% | Incomplete | 50% | **DO NOT PAY** - Stripe Connect missing (blocks platform) |
| **Phase 3** | 25% | Minimal | 20% | **DO NOT PAY** - Most features missing |
| **Phase 4** | 25% | Not Started | 0% | **DO NOT PAY** - Prerequisites not met |

### Current Fair Payment: ~15%

**Justification:**
- Solid foundational work on database, authentication, and UI
- Core features exist but critical business logic incomplete
- Platform cannot function without Stripe Connect
- Missing compliance and moderation requirements

1. Select and configure sports data API
2. Build result verification system
3. Add timestamp validation to pick creation
4. Implement edit locking
5. Test across multiple sports

### Week 5-7: Admin Dashboard + Age Verification
**Why:** Required for moderation and compliance

1. Create admin role system
2. Build moderation interface
3. Add user management tools
4. Implement Stripe Identity verification
5. Test moderation workflows

## Risk Assessment

### Launch Blockers (Must Fix Before Any Launch)
1. **Stripe Connect** - Cannot pay creators (business model broken)
2. **Age Verification** - Legal liability
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Cannot moderate content
4. **Timestamp Locking** - Users can cheat system

### Post-Launch Priorities (Can Launch Without, Add Quickly)
1. Advanced fraud detection
2. Watermarking
3. In-app notifications
4. Enhanced analytics

### Technical Debt to Address
1. Blurred preview security (currently bypassable)
2. Wallet balance tracking
3. Media upload functionality (UI exists but not connected)
4. Test coverage (currently 0%)

---

## Recommendations for Travis Shipley

### Financial
1. **Hold remaining payments** until critical features delivered
2. **Pay 15%** for Phase 1 work completed
3. **Negotiate revised timeline** for complete MVP (8-10 additional weeks)
4. **Require demo of Stripe Connect** before Phase 2 payment

### Technical Priorities
1. **Demand Stripe Connect completion first** - nothing else matters if creators can't get paid
2. **Insist on age verification** - compliance risk too high
3. **Require admin dashboard** - you need to moderate your own platform
4. **Test fraud prevention** - timestamp locking is critical

### Project Management
1. **Request weekly demos** of working features
2. **Verify Railway deployment** after each major feature
3. **Maintain staging environment** for testing before production
4. **Document all API keys and credentials** (ensure you have access)

### Launch Strategy
1. **Do NOT launch publicly** until all Phase A & B items complete
2. **Consider private beta** with 10-20 trusted users first
3. **Test payment flows extensively** with real money (small amounts)
4. **Have legal review** compliance implementation before launch
